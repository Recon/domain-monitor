#Users and roles

> **Note:** During the installation, you will be asked to create an account, which will have administrative roles

There are two types of user:

##### Administrator

- Can create and update other users (normal or administrators)
- Can remove other users (except his own account)
- Can add new domains and tests
- Will be automatically assigned to all the domains created
    
    
##### Normal user

- Can't see, edit or remove other users 
- Can update his own profile 
- Cannot add new domains or test
- Will only see the domains assigned by an administrator


------

#### Registration

Since this application is designed to provide a self-hosted monitoring solution for internal use, the registration of 
new users can only be performed by an administrator.
